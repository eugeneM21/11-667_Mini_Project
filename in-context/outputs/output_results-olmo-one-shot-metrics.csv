Recipe: Christmas Party Pinwheels

Ingredients:
- 1 package (8 oz) refrigerated crescent roll dough
- 1/2 cup finely grated pepper jack cheese
- 1/4 cup finely crumbled cooked ham
- 1/4 cup finely chopped scallion
- 1 teaspoon dried basil leaves
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
- 1 teaspoon dried paprika
- 1 teaspoon sugar

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Unroll the crescent roll dough and press it into a 10-inch circle on the prepared baking sheet, pinching the seams together to seal.
3. Bake the dough for 9-11 minutes, or until lightly golden brown. Let it cool completely on a wire rack.
4. Once the crust is cool, spread the cream cheese over the entire surface of the cooled dough, leaving about 1/2-inch border around the edges.
5. In a medium bowl, combine the finely grated pepper jack cheese, cooked ham, finely crumbled cooked bacon, scallion, dried basil, dried oregano, dried paprika, and sugar. Mix until evenly combined.
6. Spoon or pipe the cheese mixture evenly over the cream cheese, leaving the 1/2-inch border intact.
7. Using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife, cut the dough into 12 squares, cutting the squares as close to the border as possible.
8. Starting at one corner, tightly roll each square into a pinwheel shape. Make sure the border is nicely enclosed within the dough, without any air pockets.
9. Place the pinwheels 2-inches apart on a serving platter or individual plates. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or until the pinwheels are firm enough to handle.
10. Serve chilled, and enjoy!

Twice Baked Potato Casserole
-------------------------------------

**Ingredients:**
- 4 large baking potatoes, peeled and baked
- 1/2 cup finely chopped chives
- 1/2 cup finely chopped bacon

3. Add the cooked, mashed potatoes, chives, bacon, cheddar cheese, sour cream, milk, salt, and pepper to the bowl with the potato shells. Stir until everything is well combined.
4. Beat the cream cheese until it is soft. Gradually add the powdered sugar, then the vanilla extract, and continue beating until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
5. Add some of the lemon juice to the potato mixture and mix to taste. Then, add the cream cheese mixture and mix well.
6. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil or butter. Pour the potato mixture into the dish.
7. Sprinkle the crushed potato chips over the top of the casserole. Drizzle olive oil or melted butter over the potato chips.
8. Bake the casserole for 20-25 minutes, or until the potato chips are golden brown.
9. Serve the casserole hot.
