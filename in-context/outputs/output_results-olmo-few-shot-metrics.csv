- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1/2 teaspoon black food coloring
- 1/2 teaspoon red food coloring
- 1/2 teaspoon blue food coloring
- 1/2 teaspoon yellow food coloring
- 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1/4 cup almond extract (optional)
- 1/4 cup shredded coconut
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar

Instructions:
1. In a medium saucepan, combine white sugar, corn syrup, and water. Cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves.
2. Add the cream of tartar, black food coloring, red food coloring, blue food coloring, and yellow food coloring.
3. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 300 degrees F (hard-crack) on a candy thermometer.
4. Remove from heat and carefully stir in the vegetable oil and almond extract (if using).
5. Pour the hot candy onto a piece of wax paper, then spread it into a fairly thin layer, approximately 1/8 inch thick.
6. Allow the candy to cool and harden completely.
7. When the candy is firm, break it into small pieces and gently crumble it into fine shards.
8. In a separate bowl, mix together the powdered sugar.
9. Add the crumbled candy pieces to the powdered sugar and stir to combine.
10. Shape the candy mixture into 1-inch wide strips, then twist the ends of each strip to create a cathedral window effect.
11. Allow the candy to dry completely before serving or storing.

Note: You may need to adjust the food coloring amounts to achieve your desired colors. This candy can be made without the almond extract, but it adds a nice flavor and helps to prevent the candy from sticking to your hands while shaping.",1.6162491404972792e-155,0.17995910020449898,0.03285420944558522,0.11860940695296522,0.8258000612258911,0.6316832304000854,0.406978040933609,0.23352466692444593,0.06569343065693431,0.7923984527587891,0.862141489982605,0.8258000612258911,"tensor(-0.0060, device='mps:0')",1

## Ingredients:
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (8 oz each)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 cup frozen peas and carrots, thawed
- 1/2 cup frozen corn, thawed
- 1/4 cup diced onion
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 1/2 cups Panko breadcrumbs
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/2 cup milk, plus more as needed

## Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides for easy removal later. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, beat the chicken with a fork or your fingers until finely flaked. Add the thawed peas, thawed corn, diced onion, olive oil, 1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, beaten egg, finely chopped fresh parsley, melted butter, salt, and pepper. Stir until evenly combined, then gradually add the milk and continue stirring until the mixture forms a soft dough. If too sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is no longer sticky.
3. Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and arrange them tightly in the prepared baking dish, spacing them about 1/2 inch apart.
4. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the chicken balls are cooked through and lightly browned on the edges.
5. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/2 cup flour, milk, and a pinch of salt. Drizzle in the melted butter while continually whisking. The sauce should be smooth and free of lumps. If it looks too thin or runny, let it boil for 1-2 minutes, or until it reaches your desired thickness.
6. Remove the chicken balls from the oven, and, using a spatula, carefully spread the sauce over the top, covering each chicken ball as evenly as possible. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs over the top of the sauce.

Chocolate Biscotti Recipe

**Ingredients**

* 2 cups (12 oz/355 g) semi-sweet chocolate, chopped
* 1/2 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 3 cups (12 oz/350 g) granulated sugar
* 3 eggs
* 2 1/2 cups (6 oz/148 g) all-purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract
* 1 lb (453.6 g) biscotti or Italian almond cookies, broken into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces
* 1 lb (453.6 g) powdered sugar
* 1/4 cup (60 ml) milk

**Instructions**

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and set aside.

2. In a medium-sized heat-safe bowl, add the chocolate and butter. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler), ensuring that the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Melt the chocolate and butter together, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove the bowl from the pot and allow the chocolate to cool slightly.

3. In a large mixing bowl, beat the sugar, eggs, and vanilla until the mixture is smooth and light in color. Gradually add the cooled chocolate into the egg mixture, beating constantly until well combined.

4. Add the all-purpose flour and baking powder into the bowl, and mix until a dough forms.

5. Divide the dough into two equal parts and roll each portion into logs about 12 inches (30 cm) long and 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 3 inches (7.5 cm) apart. Pat the logs gently to flatten them slightly.

6. Bake the logs for 25-30 minutes or until they're lightly golden brown. Remove the logs from the oven and allow them to cool completely.

7. Using a serrated knife, slice the logs diagonally into 1/2-inch (1 cm) slices. Place the slices on their sides on the baking sheet, which has been lined with parchment paper.

8. Bake the biscotti slices again for 8-10 minutes or until they're crispy.

| John Doe | March 15, 2023 | Olive Garden | 4 stars | My family and I recently dined at Olive Garden for the first time in several years, and we were impressed by the quality of food and exceptional service we received. The restaurant was clean, and our server was attentive and friendly. The pasta dishes were delicious, with generous portions of fresh ingredients, and the breadsticks were warm and perfectly chewy. We also appreciated the variety of dessert options, including the classic Limoncello Cream Cheese Cake, which was light, creamy, and absolutely delightful. Overall, we were thrilled with our dining experience at Olive Garden, and we would definitely return and recommend the restaurant to others. |

Recipe: Beer Battered Fried Shrimp

### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup cornstarch
- 1/2 cup beer (lemon-lime is best)
- 1/2 tsp. baking powder
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 6 large shrimp, peeled and de-veined (16-20 count)
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup cornstarch
- 1/2 cup flour (for dredging)
- 1/2 cup flour (for dredging)
- Vegetable oil for frying

### Directions:
1. In a shallow dish, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt.
2. In another shallow dish, combine the remaining all-purpose and cornstarch flours and set aside.
3. To coat the shrimp, dredge them first in the all-purpose flour, then in the cornstarch, followed by the reserved all-purpose flour and cornstarch.
4. Carefully lower the shrimp into the beer batter (the beer should be about 1/3 full). Gently lift and turn the shrimp to ensure they're evenly coated.
5. Carefully remove the shrimp from the batter, allowing any excess batter to drain off. Place the shrimp on a clean plate or tray.
6. Once all of the shrimp are coated, heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or large saucepan to 375°F (190°C).
7. Carefully add several shrimp at a time to the oil, being sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry the shrimp for about 2-3 minutes or until golden brown.
8. Remove the shrimp from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat this process with the remaining shrimp.

Title: German Potato Salad

Ingredients:
- 2 large russet potatoes, cubed
- 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
- 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
- 1/2 cup chopped yellow bell pepper
- 1/4 cup chopped white onion
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup white vinegar
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup chopped hard-boiled egg
- 1/2 cup diced pimentos

Directions:
1. Cut potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Place in a pot and add enough cold water to cover the potatoes. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 10-15 minutes. Drain the potatoes and let them cool. You can also cook the potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl with enough water, covered, until tender, about 5-7 minutes, stirring once halfway through.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the potatoes, bell peppers, white onion, fresh dill, sugar, white vinegar, vegetable oil, salt, and pepper. Mix together until all the ingredients are well distributed.
3. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, hard-boiled egg, and pimentos.
4. Add the dressing mixture to the potato mixture and stir gently to coat the potatoes evenly. Serve chilled or at room temperature. Enjoy!

## Notes ##
* German Potato Salad is typically made without mayonnaise, but this recipe adds mayonnaise and sour cream for a creamier, less sour dressing.
* Feel free to adjust the sugar and vinegar amounts to your personal preference.
* For a more traditional German Potato Salad, you can use a mix of potatoes like Yukon Golds, or try using a different type of vegetable like carrots or peas in place of bell peppers.
* If you prefer a spicier potato salad, you can add a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes before serving.",8.217214546069653e-79,0.3071672354948805,0.05821917808219178,0.13651877133105803,0.8421167731285095,0.6226369142532349,0.5972833037376404,0.4223252656310508,0.10835913312693499,0.8155137896537781,0.870513916015625,0.8421167731285095,"tensor(-0.0345, device='mps:0')",7

Title: Twice Baked Potato Casserole

Ingredients:
- 4 large baking potatoes
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- Salt & pepper, to taste
- 1 cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
- 8 oz cream cheese, softened
- 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup freshly chopped chives

Directions:
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Place the baking potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 12-15 minutes, or until tender. 
3. Once cooked, let cool for 5 minutes before handling. Cut each potato in half lengthwise, and using a fork, gently scrape the inside of the potato, creating a ""mash"" texture. 
4. In a large mixing bowl, add the potato mash, 1/2 cup of unsalted butter, light brown sugar, egg, salt, and pepper. Using an electric mixer or a large spoon, mix until well combined and no lumps of potato remain. 
5. Transfer the mixture into your prepared baking sheet, spreading it evenly into a rectangle shape. 
6. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until the top is lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. 
7. Once cooled, use a fork to “fluff” the top of the casserole. Place the baking sheet back into the oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the top is lightly golden and the potatoes are warmed through. 
8. While the casserole is baking, prepare the chive cream by combining the cream cheese, shredded cheddar cheese, and freshly chopped chives in a small bowl. Mix until well combined and smooth.
9. Once the casserole is fully baked and cooled, spread the chive cream evenly over the top, then sprinkle with extra chives if desired. 
10. Serve immediately and enjoy!

Note: You can also substitute the frozen spinach with any other frozen vegetables or meat, if desired.",1.9492275242760077e-155,0.16266173752310537,0.06679035250463822,0.09981515711645102,0.822192370891571,0.6715333461761475,0.5770926475524902,0.22798238287969774,0.043478260869565216,0.7892518639564514,0.8580021858215332,0.822192370891571,"tensor(-0.0131, device='mps:0')",5
