## Cathedral Window Candy

**Ingredients:**

* 2 cups granulated sugar
* 1 cup light corn syrup
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Red food coloring (gel or liquid)
* Assorted hard candies, unwrapped (like Jolly Ranchers or Life Savers)

**Directions:**

1. **Prepare the candy syrup:** In a medium saucepan, combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt. Stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. 
2. **Cook the syrup:** Once the sugar is dissolved, clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. Bring the mixture to a boil without stirring. Continue boiling until the syrup reaches 300°F (hard-crack stage). This will take about 10-15 minutes. 
3. **Add flavoring:** Remove the pan from the heat and immediately stir in the vanilla extract. If desired, divide the syrup into a few bowls and add a few drops of red food coloring to each bowl to create different colored syrups.
4. **Assemble the windows:** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Working quickly, drop spoonfuls of the hot candy syrup onto the prepared baking sheet.  Immediately place a few hard candies in the center of each puddle of syrup.  
5. **Let cool and harden:** Allow the candy to cool and harden completely. This will take about 30-45 minutes.  Once hardened, gently peel the candy from the parchment paper.

**Tips:**

* Be careful when working with hot sugar syrup. It can cause severe burns.
* Use a candy thermometer to ensure that the syrup reaches the correct temperature.
* If the syrup starts to crystallize, you can add a tablespoon of water to the pan and stir gently.
* For a more intricate design, you can use different shapes and colors of hard candies.",3.1964111675788254
