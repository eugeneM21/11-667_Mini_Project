Ingredients:
- 6 thick slices of your favorite bread
- 1/2 cup creamy vanilla yogurt
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1/2 cup ricotta cheese, drained and patted dry with paper towels
- 1/2 cup fresh berries (such as strawberries, blackberries, or raspberries)
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
- Fresh mint leaves, for garnish (optional)

Instructions:

1. Start by preparing the filling. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the vanilla yogurt, powdered sugar, whole milk, pure maple syrup, and honey until smooth and well combined.

2. Now, prepare the bread. Preheat a griddle or skillet over medium heat. You can also use a toaster oven to reduce the wait time for your toast.

3. While the bread is toasting, beat the egg in a large bowl.

4. Take one slice of bread and dip it into the beaten egg, coating it thoroughly. Place the bread on the preheated griddle or toaster oven, and repeat with the remaining slices. Cook the bread for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.

5. While the bread is cooking, prepare the filling. In a clean medium-sized bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, fresh berries, granulated sugar, ground cinnamon, and ground allspice. Mix until the berries are evenly distributed.

6. Once the bread is cooked, let it cool for a minute or two. Then, spread a generous amount of the vanilla yogurt filling over the bread, leaving about 1/2 inch of space around the edges.

7. Gently place another slice of bread on top of the vanilla yogurt, so that it creates a sandwich.

8. Heat a small amount of unsalted butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Once melted, carefully place the sandwiches in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.",1.9172251498922952
